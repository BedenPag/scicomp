    "\n",
    "The Euler method is a first-order numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It uses a forward difference approximation to estimate the derivative of the solution at each time step and updates the solution accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's method has a first-order global truncation error ($O(h)$), which means that the error in the approximation is proportional to the time step. It is simple to implement but may not be accurate for stiff ODEs which are ODEs with rapidly changing or oscillatory solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runge-Kutta methods are a family of numerical methods for solving ODEs. These methods work by approximating the solution of an ODE at discrete time steps. The most commonly used Runge-Kutta method is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4). The RK4 method uses a weighted average of four derivative evaluations to estimate the derivative of the solution at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "RK4 has a fourth-order global truncation error ($O(h^4)$), so it is more accurate than Euler's method. It is also important to note that RK4 is more robust to stiff ODEs than Euler's method.\n",

    "The numerical shooting method is a numerical method for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) for ODEs. BVPs are differential equations within a domain with defined constraints, called boundary conditions. Numerical shooting is particularly useful for solving BVPs where the boundary conditions are unknown or difficult to determine.\n",

    "The solve_to_shooting function is the main function for solving the ODE using the shooting method. If the input initial values are for a two-dimensional system, then solve_to_shooting calls the shooting2 function, otherwise, it calls the shooting function. After finding the initial value for the dependent variable using the shooting method, it calls the solve_to function from the ODEsolve.py file to solve the ODE using the given step function. The function then returns the time and dependent variable values.\n",

The results can be compared with other numerical methods to validate the accuracy of the method. By plotting the phase portrait of the system when $b <  0.26$ we see there is a stable limit cycle because the prey and predator populations oscillate around the equilibrium point. When $b > 0.26$ the system has a stable equilibrium point because the populations converge to the equilibrium point."

For Neumann and Robin boundary conditions, the approximations are not similar to the exact solution but are similar to one another.

For example, the euler_step and rk4_step functions are used in the shooting method solver. The modularity of the ODE solver is important as it allows the user to input their own one or two-dimensional ODEs and initial conditions. The step function is also taken as input so the user can choose or even create their step function to use in the solver. \n",

Every error message is descriptive and explains what the user did wrong which makes it easy for the user to fix their mistake. I attempted unit testing for the ODE solver but I was not able to get it to work. I would like to learn how to do this in the future because it would make the code much more reliable. The only limitation to the solver is that the ODE must be one or two-dimensional but I believe this is a reasonable limitation. Other than that, the solver is very robust and can solve any ODE as long as the user inputs the correct arguments.\n",

This makes the code modular and easy to use in other solvers if needed. The code is also reliable because the arguments are checked for validity before the code is executed. Overall the file is well-organized and efficient at solving ODEs. However, the code is not very robust because it can only solve one and two-dimensional ODEs.\n",

Both use the 'root' function within Scipy. I chose to use this function over 'fsolve' because it can keep track of the success and failure of the solver. This allowed me to output the range at which the solver failed when using the natural parameter method. I also started using Numpy arrays instead of lists in this file because they are more capable of doing mathematical operations. They are also quicker than lists which is important when using large arrays.

This turned out to be effective as the PDE solver also uses the same class. The file 'MethodOfLines_class.py' contains two classes. The 'Grid' class creates a discrete grid and the 'BoundaryCondition' class creates the boundary conditions. There is also a function to construct A and b matrices that the 'BoundaryCondition' class can manipulate depending on the boundary type. I chose to do it this way because it allows the user to create their own boundary conditions by creating a new instance of the 'BoundaryCondition' class. The file 'BVPsolve.py' is well-organized and allows the user complete freedom to create their own boundary conditions because there are 9 different arguments to modify. The code uses Numpy's 'linalg' module to solve the system of equations. The code is also reliable because it checks for invalid arguments before executing the code. I feel this is my best code because it is very robust and can solve any BVP as long as the user inputs the correct arguments.

The function is well-documented so it is easy for the user to understand what each argument does. The function is also reliable because there are lots of checks for invalid arguments. I created a solver for just explicit Euler called 'EEmethod.py' that worked well, but it was messy and slow. So, like the BVP solver, the PDE solver uses the MOL class to create the matrices and Numpy's 'linalg' module to solve the system of equations.

    "Throughout this unit, I have gained a wealth of knowledge regarding software engineering principles. As well as how to tackle the challenges involved in developing functional and well-documented code. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem before beginning the code. At the start of the course, I was rushing through sections that ended up causing a lot of hassle later down the line. By mapping out precisely what needs to be done beforehand, the issues became much clearer towards the end of the course. In addition, planning enabled me to consider the program's structure.\n",
    "Furthermore, I have discovered that writing docstrings for the code as I go along is an effective way to approach this task. Initially, I had planned to complete this step at the end, but I soon realized that it is much more beneficial doing it as I went. Describing what the function does, the inputs it requires, and the outputs it produces helped me view the function as part of the bigger picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, I have gained valuable abilities. I have learned how useful classes can be when done correctly. Moreover, I have improved my use of git. By committing changes regularly as soon as a piece of code works, I can keep a log of my work and rectify any future errors by reverting to prior commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course has also encouraged me to think more critically about the quality of my code. I now consider how different functions interact and pass values to one another and how to make it more user-friendly for others to use and develop. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well in future professional endeavours and when revisiting old code projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If allowed to start the unit again, I would thoroughly plan what I want out of each function. I would also seek more assistance from the TAs early on to help me understand how functions should interact. Doing this would give me the time to perform unit testing on all my code, which is a skill I would like to learn. To increase modularity, I would use more classes. To make my code more reliable, I would make each function more general so it is possible to solve higher-dimension differential equations. Finally, to improve efficiency I would use sparse matrices for BVPs and PDEs as well as implement Numpy arrays throughout the functions."
